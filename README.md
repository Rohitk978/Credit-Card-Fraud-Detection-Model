Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a neural network. It analyzes transaction data to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, addressing the challenge of highly imbalanced data where fraud cases are rare. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation, with a focus on maximizing fraud detection while minimizing false positives.
Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms transaction data, including numerical scaling and categorical encoding.
Feature Engineering: Creates features to capture transaction patterns, such as geographical distances and temporal trends.
Model: A neural network designed for binary classification, optimized for imbalanced data.
Training: Uses techniques to handle class imbalance, ensuring effective fraud detection.
Evaluation: Assesses performance with metrics suited for fraud detection, including ROC AUC, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Interpretability: Analyzes feature importance to understand key drivers of fraud predictions.

Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher
Libraries: Install via requirements.txt (includes machine learning and visualization packages).
Dataset: Credit card transaction data in CSV format (not included).

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection


Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt


Place your dataset (e.g., train_data.csv, test_data.csv) in the project directory.

Usage

Update file paths in the main script to point to your dataset.
Run the script:python fraud_detection.py


The script will:
Preprocess the data.
Train the model.
Evaluate performance on test data.
Generate visualizations (e.g., ROC curve, confusion matrix).
Save predictions to a CSV file.



Output

Metrics: Performance scores including ROC AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizations: Plots for model performance and feature importance.
Predictions: CSV file with fraud probabilities and binary predictions for test data.
